### Omega Zoom

Omega Zoom is *the* best zoom mod. Do not trust any other Zoom mod that makes the same claim. 
Here's why:

- **Public Domain license**: Omega Zoom code is 100% Public Domain and all bundled libraries are MIT.
- **Tiny file size**: <=60KB binaries makes this project 3-5x smaller than leading competitors, while still including a full configuration system and GUI config editor.
- **Intuitive**: default options and feels are copied from popular alternative Zoom solutions, making it a seamless transition for new users.
- **Modern**: Omega Zoom supports modern Minecraft on Fabric 1.18 and forward.
- **Configurable**: everything in Omega Zoom is fully customizable - make it your own!
- **Community-oriented**: request a feature and I will add it.

### Configuration

Open the configuration file at `config/omegazoom.json5`. 
Mod Menu users can open an interactive config menu through the Omega Config mod screen.
